<h2>How to tamper with electronic health records ...</h2>
<hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2"> <br>

<p>
Well - this essay is in fact about how <b>any</b> document on literally
<b> any</b> computer system can be tampered with. Electronic health records
are just one good example where it becomes  obvious that a "closed" computer
system is <b>always</b> untrustworthy   regarding data integrity.
</p>

<p>
Under "closed computer system" we understand a single computers or a
cluster of computers connected together in a <b>local</b> network.
No data leaves the system.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious that medical health records need to fulfil the following
criteria in order to be useful in a court case as evidence:
</p>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>
        <p>
        <b>proof of authorship:</b> this can be achieved with digital signatures.
        It is an entirely different can of worms from our topic here and will
        not be discussed
        </p>
  </li>
  <li>
        <p>
        <b>proof of integrity:</b> you must be able to prove that the records
        could not have been altered since they have been generated for the first
        time. This includes both accidental (data corruption) and illegitimate
        (data   tampering) alterations.
        </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
It is not too difficult to prove absence of data corruption, simply by
using strong checksum algorithms (like MD5) - we will not discuss this
topic yet.   Here we will focus on the possibility of illegitimate document
tampering   and how to prevent it.
</p>

<p>
Are you sure that your system is tamper proof? How would you know? What
if  it comes to a court case, and all that is between winning
the case or losing  your medical registration are your electronic
health records, and all of  a sudden an IT expert enters the witness
box and <i><b>proves that you can't prove</b></i> that your health
records have not been illegitimately altered?
</p>

<p>
This is such an important issue that you must not succumb to believe commercial
blurb. You must check yourself, you must find out how exactly data integrity
is guaranteed on your system, or you should not risk going paperless.
</p>

<p>
There are misinformed or even dishonest software vendors who claim that
they can prevent data tampering in a reliable way by several countermeasures,
including:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
        <p>
        <a href="#password">password protected access restriction</a>
        </p>
  </li>
  <li>
        <p>
        <a href="#nondisclosure">non-disclosure of internal data structures
        and file formats</a>
        </p>
  </li>
  <li>
        <p>
        <a href="#secrettrail">leaving "secret" audit trails on the hard disk</a>
        </p>
  </li>
  <li>
        <p>
        <a href="#encryption">encrypting information</a>
        </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
I will now demonstrate one by one how these countermeasures can
be circumvented. Most software vendors are of course using a
combination of all these measures in the attempt to make it more difficult
to "hack". ". I will show you that all they achieve in reality is to
waste a little more of the "hackers" time.
</p>

<p>
After this demonstration, I will present <a href="#generic">a generic
approach</a> how <b>any</b> document can be modified regardless of  the
software that was used to generate the data without any need for so called
"hacking". This generic approach is a proof for the impossibility of proving
data integrity in a closed system.
</p>

<p>
Before you despair and abandon paperless health records, I will show you
that it is perfectly possible to <a href="methods.html"> guarantee
data integrity</a>  with little extra effort- an effort that should
be undertaken by your software vendor.
</p>

<br> <hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2"><br>
<ol>
  <li>
        <h3><a name="password"></a>password protected access restriction</h3>
        <p>
        If the program relies on password checking alone to give you access
        to  the  data, and does not protect the data otherwise,
        it is easy. You simply access the data with different software
        (like text editors in  the most simple case). Health IT is a serious
        business. Confidential patient data should not be entrusted to a security
        &ldquo;system&rdquo; that can, in the most simple of cases, be bypassed by
        simply opening up a data file in a text editor. In some cases, the password
        is used to unlock data encryption.  Unfortunately, this approach makes
        it all too easy to circumvent anti tampering provisions.
        </p>

        <p>
        A program is nothing but a flow of instructions. The program flow
        branches to different subroutines depending on information. Common password
        protection schemes include subroutines that check the password against
        a hash code of that password (i.e. they do not store the password itself).
        The routine that checks the password branches to different subroutines,
        depending on whether the entered password was right or wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
        With basic software tools called "debuggers" and "disassemblers" it
        is possible to reverse engineer binary program code intohuman readable form
        and execute program instructions step by step. That way, it is possible
        to find the subroutine that decides which way to branch: either to
        accept or to reject the password. From here it is simple just to swap
        the branching, so that the program will accept the password
        whenever it is wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
        Software vendors have tried many different approaches to make
        this procedure more difficult, but a quick look at the computer game market
        shows that there is no sofware resistant to reverse engineering
        for a long time.
        </p>
  </li>
  <br> <hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2"><br>
  <li>
        <h3>
        <a name="nondisclosure"></a>non-disclosure of internal data structures
        and file formats
        </h3>

        <p>
        Reverse engineering data structures and file formats is often easier
        than reverse engineering password access. Most structures can be found out
        using a binary editor (sort of a text editior that gives you direct access
        at byte level to information stored on the hard disk) and searching for patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
        As you  can use the software that generated the pattern,
        you can save the file containing the information you want to manipulate,
        enter some information, compare the altered file with the previous
        file for differences. There are good software tools freely available (like
        "diff") that make this process very easy.
        </p>

        <p>
        Repeat this a few times, and you will get enough information to reconstruct
        internal data structures and file formats.
        </p>

  <br> <hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2"><br>
  <li>
        <h3> <a name="secrettrail"></a>leaving "secret" audit trails on the hard disk</h3>

        <p>
        In this case, I can save the status of my hard disk before installing
        the software and after using it, and then compare the differences
        as outlined above. Writing information to the hard disk means calling
        subroutines provided by operating system or BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).
        Calling these subroutines can easily be intercepted, and a filter in the intercepting
        subroutine can comfortably log any write access for my perusal. It is not
        possible to hide write access to the hard disk, and it is not possible to
        prevent me from finding out what has changed on  the harddisk between
        two different times of software use.
        </p>

  </li>
  <br> <hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2"><br>
  <li>

        <h3><a name="encryption"></a>encrypting information</h3>

        <p>
        This is often the hardest nut to crack, and sometimes impractical.
        Most software vendors seem to rely on flawed or simplicistic
        cryptography provided by 3rd party vendors who are notorious for incorrect
        implementation of security tools (such as Microsofts implementations of a
        virtual private network PPtP: read about it
        <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/pptp.html"> here</a> - a basically
        reasonable technology, particularly useful for linking
        surgeries together, has been compromised by artificially reducing the keyspace
        and other flaws). Companies selling "password recovery" for many of the popular
        software packages such as Microsoft Access are abundant on the net, examples
        are found <a href="http://www.passwordrecovery.com/"> here </a> and
        <a href="http://www.lostpassword.com/"> here</a>, but you may find better ones
        using your favourite search engines.

<blockquote>
        <p>
        However, we don't have to waste too much time trying to circumvent
        cryptography. In most cases, we can trigger the internal decryption routines
        without need to know about them simply by using the password reverse
        engineering approach. Although I haven't come across a medical software
        package yet where this would not yield the desired result, I will now
        outline a generic approach  how any anti-tampering method of any software
        vendor can be circumvented, provided no data leaves our closed system
        before the tampering happens.

<h2><a name="generic"></a>A generic approach towards tampering electronic health records    </h2>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>
        <p>
        Generate an exact byte-by-byte replica of my hard disk partition
        and my BIOS settings. Tools like "Partition Magic" or the free
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/">
        GNU Parted</a> make this very easy and straightforward. Most modern
        mainboards with flash BIOS come with utility software that allows you
        to save your BIOS  settings - but there are more sophisticated tools freely
        available on the  net. Partition image and BIOS image together represent
        a true &bdquo;snapshot&ldquo; of a computer system for any given time.
        Cheap storage media like CD-R, allow to generate snapshots as often
        as necessary. Restoring from; a snapshot will exactly reproduce the status
        of a system for any given time.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        Install a software utility which intercepts all input events (mouse,
        keyboard) and stores them time stamped in a log file. This is particularly
        easy in the Windows environment. You can write your own if you have basic
        programming skills in low level languages such as C, or you may contract
        a programmer to have it written for you, or you can search the
        web for such tools - <a href=interception.html> they <b>do</b> exist </a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> Suppose you want to illegitimately alter electronic medical
        records from last year. Without any knowledge about the file structure
        or the cryptographic features of the medical software package that was
        used to generate and save these records, you would simply open the last
        log file before that time, search for the entry you want to change, and
        enter as many keyboard / mouse events as necessary.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        After restoring the BIOS settings and restoring the partition
        image onto the hard disk  you would replay all captured
        keyboard and mouse events (including the ones you just manipulated).
        A good interceptor utility would adjust the hardware clock accordingly during
        playback, thus making it impossible to track the changes down
        later on.
        </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<p>The health record has now been altered, and neither your medical
software nor any other software on your computer would have been able
to detect the manipulation.<b> It would be impossible for even the best
IT specialist to detect it</b>
</p>

<p>
In practice, it is not necessary to resort to such methods. Simple reverse
engineering and &bdquo;hacking&ldquo; is virtually always successful.   <br>
You don't believe me? Have a look at <a href="interception.html">this page.</a><br>
</p>

<p>
On a similar line it should be mentioned that software can't even be sure it is running on
the platform it supposes it runs. Hardware emulators and "virtual machines" blossom
the more restrictive hard- and software vendors get; software like
<a href="ttp://www.vmware.com"> "vmware" </a> for example
allows to create virtual machines that to any software look like a standard PC running
Windows 98 or Windows NT, yet they might run on some UNIX operating system running on
some exotic processor with hardware entirely different to what Windows system calls
will make the software believe. <b> It is a fact that software never can safely make any
assumptions as to which platform and hardware it is really running on, let alone finding out
at what time it is running. It is too simple to emulate even connections to time servers on
the net</b> It should be obvious by now, that it definitely impossible to avoid tampering
under these circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Even Microsoft has realized that "resistance is futile", that it is <b> impossible </b>
to make any software defense mechanism uncrackable. A quote from their own
<a href= "http://research.microsoft.com/crypto/piracy.asp"> web site </a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>
   " ... But given enough time to scour the operating code for the lines that operate the softwares
   defenses, a skilled cracker can always find them and remove or disable them no matter how
   carefully they are hidden and disguised. In the software piracy game, the attacker always
   has the advantage  he is invisible, he has as much time as he needs and he is often as
   skilled as the defender. The defender can watch how the cracker operates, learn from the
   way he exploits the code and close the holes he exposes, <b> <u> but because of the open nature
   of the personal computer it is next to impossible to design a piece of software that can
   never be cracked </u> </b>. The trick is to come up with new defenses that will be unfamiliar to
   crackers, to make cracking such a laborious, time consuming process that it takes weeks and
   weeks to find and disable every carefully hidden piece of code. ... "
   </p>
