                    <p>
                    The GNotary client is a Python script providing a graphical
                    user interface to the common tasks of selecting files for a
                    backup, calculating strong hashes for each file, and storing
                    files in a compressed ZIP archive file. By pressing a single button,
                    the hashes of the selected files are calculated and sent to one or
                    more notary servers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It should run on any platform supporting Python and the wxPython toolkit.
                    I have tested it only on Gnu/Linux and Windows.
                    <p>
                    At present I am busy with other projects, I would welcome if somebody would
                    continue development and biuld some binaries (built with py2exe) for download.
                    However, the software already works as it is; it just would benefit from additional
                    functionality and some polishing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    At present, I am using the MD5 algorithm.
                    However, the final version should use the more trustworthy

                    <p>The &quot;server&quot; is a simple python script which
                        grabs incoming mail that matches a filter condition, pipes
                        this mail through the signing process of the GNU privacy
                        guard, retains a copy of the signed message, and sends
                        the signed message back to the sender.

                    <p>
                        In the future, all notary servers will exchange message digests of
                        their own certificate log mutually (and get them mutually certified),

                        a single mail certificate on a single server would invalidate all other
                        log certificates in an auditable and traceable way).

    The GNotary GUI client: working features include drag-and-drop of files,
    hashing the selected files with MD5, archiving all selected files into a zip
    archive, and sending all hashes by email to a list of notary servers.
    <p>
    Usage: start the client. Open the file manager (Konqueror, Explorer ...) of
    your choice. Drag and drop as many files as you want into the open client
    window. Click the button to either create the archive or to send the hashes
    to the server list. You will be prompted for your email parameters and
    notary server email addresses if they haven't been configured.
