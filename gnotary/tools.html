   ... or even longer; who knows, maybe you become fond of&nbsp; nicely crafted 
  shell scripts?<br>

  <li>anything written in <font color="#cc0000">red<font color="#000000">
   is what you have to enter at the system prompt</font></font><br>
    </li>
   
</ul>

  <li>Get the GNU Privacy Guard from <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">http://www.gnupg.org 
  and install it</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.pdf">Download the PDF documentation</a>
, optionally print it out<a href="http://www.gnupg.org"></a>, but READ IT!</li>
       
  <li>Generate your own keyset:, following the instructions available <a href="http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html#ss3.1">
here</a>. </li>
  <li>Take your time to thin of a pass phrase that you can memorize. Read
the instructions regarding pass phrases carefully!<a href="http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html#ss3.1"></a></li>
       
  <li>Exchange keys with a trusted 3rd party like your Divison of General
Practice</li>
       
  <li>Make a compressed backup of the files you want to notarize with your 
  favourite backup software</li>
       
  <li>Sign the compressed backup file with <font color="#cc0000">gpg -ba 
 &lt;your-file-name&gt;</font></li>
       
  <li>This will create a file &lt;your-file-name&gt;.asc after you entered 
  your passphrase at the prompt</li>
       
  <li>Check the signature with <font color="#ff0000">gpg --verify &lt;your-file-name&gt;.asc 
  &lt;your-file-name&gt;</font><br>
    </li>

  A message will show you when your document has been signed, what algorithm 
  and key had been used, who had signed your document, and whether the integrity 
  of your document can be guaranteed.</li>
       
  <li>Send this message by email to your trusted third party</li>
       
  <li>Your trusted third party signs the message same way as you did, just
&nbsp;&nbsp; using their private key for the signature</li>
       
  <li>Then they email it back to you. Keep both your signature and theirs.</li>
       
  <li>In order to be able to verify their signature, you need to import their
&nbsp;&nbsp; public key. </li>
       
  <li>Make regular backups of your signatures and keyrings. </li>
       
  <li>Keep track of which file has been notarized with which signature</li>
  <li><big><font color="#cc0000"><i><b>Never ever give your private key away.
Keep it the same way as if would be a million Dollars in cash.</b></i></font></big><big>
 </big><big><font color="#cc0000"><i><b>Never ever even think about writing
your passphrase down. </b></i></font></big><br>
    </li>
   
</ol>
  See, no magic involved.The nice thing with GNotary will be that all of
the   above can be achieved with a few mouse clicks (well, you still have
to enter   your passphrase once per session as well).<br>
