<h2>Examples for Freeware or Shareware software that can assist in health
record tampering:</h2>
<hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2"><br>
This section contains only few links to web sites where such tools can be
downloaded. The text below the links are original quotes from these web sites,
detailing some features of each software. I only grabbed a few example of
literally thousands of programs that can be downloaded any time for little
or no money. <i><b>For legitimate purposes, these tools are valuable and
very helpful indeed - in fact, most of them are not primarily designed for
tampering purposes. Most of these tools just help you to automatize tedious
boring tasks.</b></i><br>
<br>
This site is <b>not</b> meant to encourage anybody to engage in health
record tampering. It is to make a point that inauditable tampering can already
be achieved by just downloading easy to use tools, and not overly much computer
knowledge is required to use them. Of course, one single tool only would often not
be enough to annihilate all anti tampering provisions.<br>
<br>
An example setup would be similar to this one:<br>
<br>
1.)Download gnu parted from http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/, follow the
instructions on http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/USER (Paragraph 8, Disk
Imaging)<br>
<br>
2.) Partition your hard disk, have at least one spare "mirror" partition<br>
<br>
3.) make a snapshot of your system onto the mirror partition: now you can
travel back in time any time by reinstalling this partition image (or simply
booting into it with the help of a bootmanager, such as Smart Boot Manager
from http://www.gnuchina.org/~suzhe/<br>
<br>
4.) install one of the registry/file monitors from below to check what exactly
the software you use changes on the harddsk during normal operation to get
a roug idea what to look for<br>
<br>
5.) install one of the "macro recorders" tha allow you time stamped logging
(&amp; replay) of mouse and keyboard events.<br>
<br>
6.) Now you are almost ready for time travel at any time! Mind you, this
is a very simplicistic approach, and I personally would not trust it. <br>
<br>
<font color="#cc0000"><b>It is in the very best interets of any doctor entrusting
health records to a computer to know about the security loopholes, and to
know what weight his records might have as evidence in court as a consequence
of these loopholes. When you see how easy it is to follow steps 1-6, you
will agree that you need to be proactive in order to preserve the value of
your Electronic Health Records. I have shown the "notary solution", you might
come up with other solutions (which you hopefully will <a href="mailto:hherb@gnumed.net">
share with us</a>) - but we definitely need a solution to this problem.</b></font><br>

<h3>PC Activity Monitor</h3>
(http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hills/8839/pcacme.html)<br>
<br>
PC Activity Monitor (PC Acme) is a powerful security program that tracks
and reports all activity on your PC. <br>
 It also <i><font color="#ff0000">captures hidden passwords and displays
the key(s) that were pushed when entering the password</font>.</i><br>
<br>
PC Activity Monitor Pro (PC Acme Pro) is a powerful yet easy-to-use general-purpose
security program that tracks and reports all activity on your PC and optionally
emails the activity log to a preconfigured e-mail address.<br>
<font color="#ff0000"><i>It records not only all keystrokes, but all window
titles and times, clipboard activity, and more</i></font>. It records your
computer startup and shutdown times, as well as the names of all running
tasks. <br>
It runs invisibly. You won't see it on the task list, task bar, or system-tray
area and has a minimal impact on system performance. <br>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Macro Scheduler</h3>
(http://www.mjtnet.com/index.mv?msched6.html)<br>
<br>
Macro Scheduler (or MSched) is a powerful scheduling and macro scripting
tool for Windows 9x, NT and 2000. Scripts can be built to control any program
or command which accepts keyboard and mouse input. Alternatively, <font color="#ff0000"><i>
mouse and keyboard events can be 'captured' using the built in macro recorder</i></font>
. You can <font color="#ff0000"><i>even edit recorded macros!</i></font>
Any number of macros can then be scheduled to take place at a specified time
on any day or days of the week, and if required can be repeated at regular
intervals<br>
<br>

<h3>WhatChanged for Windows</h3>
(http://www.prismmicrosys.com/whatchanged/)<br>
<br>
 The program <font color="#cc0000"><i>takes and stores snapshots which include
detailed information on all files, directories, registry and system configuration
information</i></font><br>
<br>
<hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2"><br>
<h3>Advanced Registry Tracer</h3>
(http://www.elcomsoft.com/art.html)<br>
<br>
Advanced Registry Tracer (ART; formely RegFix) is an utility designed for
analysing the changes made to Windows Registry - by making the "snapshots"
of it and keeping them in the browsable database. You can compare any two
snapshots and get the list of keys/data which are new, deleted or just changed.
ART can do comparing not only in the entire Regisrty, but also in any key
of the Registry. It is also possible to exclude any keys of the Registry
from compare results. Moreover, you can create undo/redo files (for example,
to rollback the changes). To view the current state of a key, or to modify
it, you can use Jump to Regedit function. Contents of any key can be exported
to *.reg file. <br>
<br>
Very useful for detecting trojan viruses and elimination some problems caused
by software and hardware install/uninstall. <br>
<br>
Unlike Registry monitoring software (such as RegMon and Win-Expose Registry),
and most uninstallers (CleenSweep, Uninstall, etc.), ART compares full copies
of the Registry made at different times, while the software mantioned above
just monitors all accesses to the Registry in real time. So, our method allows
to track all the changes, and doesn't affect the system performance. <br>

<h3>WinSniffer</h3>
(http://www.winsniffer.com/)<br>
<br>
The most efficient and reliable password sniffer! Win Sniffer is a study
in simplicity. Win Sniffer <font color="#cc0000"><i><b>allows network administrators
to capture passwords of any network user.</b></i></font> Win Sniffer monitor
incoming and outcoming network traffic and decode FTP, POP3, HTTP, ICQ, SMTP,
Telnet, IMAP, NNTP passwords<br>
<br>
Win Sniffer Console has almost the same functionality as a Win Sniffer 1.21,
but works in text mode. Additional feature of Win Sniffer Console is a capability
to capture outgoing mail (SMTP).<br>

<h3>Stealth Keyboard Interceptor</h3>
(http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hills/8839/skinas.html)<br>
<br>
Stealth Keyboard Interceptor AutoSender (SKIn AS) is a security program that
<font color="#cc0000"><b><i>tracks and reports all activity on your PC. All
window titles, keystrokes, menus, mouse clicks, and actions taken are recorded
</i></b></font>to a password-protected log file and optionally emailed to
a preconfigured e-mail address.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<hr align="Left" width="100%" size="2"><br>
<h3>Stealth Email Redirector</h3>
(http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Hills/8839/ser.html)<br>
<br>
Stealth Email Redirector (SER) is a program that sends the copies of all
outgoing emails. SER monitors outgoing traffic of email client software and
intercepts all sending emails. Then program <font color="#cc0000"><i>sends
out intercepted emails to specified email addresses. </i></font><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>RegSnap</h3>
RegSnap is a tool that can help you analyze changes made to the Windows Registry.
With it, you can compare saved snapshots and learn which keys were modified,
deleted, or added. You can also analyze other sensitive system parts, such
as a list of files in Windows and Windows System directories, win.ini and
system.ini files, and autoexec.bat and config.sys files. RegSnap able to
generate HTML reports, .REG files <font color="#cc0000"><i>to undo and redo
registry changes</i></font>. Pro version supports command line interface
and OLE Automation (i.e. could be scriptable from your programs). <br>

<h3>Password Tools</h3>
(http://passwordtools.com/word/default.asp)<br>
<br>
And now we proud to present new exciting version with very unique feature:
OfficePassword v3.0 able to recovery any Word/Excel documents regardless
of the password length! We estimate that about 15% of all passwords are unbreakable
with regular recovery methods (such as brute-force attack and dictionary
search). Purchasing&nbsp; regular password recovery tools you have significant
failure probability. It's like a lottery. Using OfficePassword your success
is guaranteed. Moreover guaranteed recovery much more easy to use, there
is no options to tune, just select your password-protected document! <br>
<br>
