></H2
><P
>        GnuMed does not simply store all of it's data in a monolithic database.
        It rather uses the concept of a service. A service is a set of tables
        relating to a semantically reasonably distinct part of the data. It's
        probably easiest to understand via the example of the "blobs" service.
        This service stores medical documents relating to patients. These can
        be scans of referral letters or discharge summaries, paper-based lab
        results or incoming faxes. Any aggregate of diverse medical data on a
        patient that's not easily split up and stored.
        </P
><P
>        Other services include "default" (the core database tables that tell
        your client software which service is to be found where), "personalia"
        (holding all the patient demographics), and various clinical services
        for drug data, clinical history, etc. The authoritative list of services
        is found in server/sql/gmconfiguration.sql. Any service living in the
        same database as the "default" service does not need to be mapped
        explicitely (but it can). If there's no mapping it is assumed that
        a service lives in the "default" service's database.
        </P
><P
>        Services can coexist in one and the same database on a single server
        or be spread out across several databases or even servers both on-site
        and off-site. However, non-monolithic services have not been tested
        well yet and will require the non-standard dblink PostgreSQL extension
        (found in contrib/ in the PostgreSQL source tree). Until further notice
        it is recommended to stick to non-distribution of services via
        monolithic databases except for services that don't require
        cross-database referential integrity links such as a drug database
        for informational purposes. What has been tested successfully, however,
        is access to GnuMed databases over WAN links, including via internet
        from arbitrary locations.

>        All of this is handled automatically by the script bootstrap-gm_db_system.py
        living in server/utils/. This script does not yet set up mappings of
        services to their databases/servers (although in theory it can install
        services on remote servers already). As this is not yet fully supported by
        GnuMed anyways (due to dblink being non-standard) one should stick
        to a monolithic service layout. Several sample config files for
        bootstrapping are supplied in server/utils/. </P
