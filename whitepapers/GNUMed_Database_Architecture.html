<h3>Client-Server architecture with optional middleware layers<br>
 </h3>
 GNUMed is designed as a <b><i>client-server architecture</i></b> with <i><b>
 optional middleware</b></i> components. The database backend is provided 
by PostgreSQL, a largely SQL-92 compliant&nbsp; object-relational database 
server. PostgreSQL is free software, obtainable at <a
 href="http://www.postgresql.org">http://www.postgresql.org</a>. It is portable, 
running on virtually all Posix compatible systems including Gnu/Linux, BSD 
Unix, Solaris, Mac OS/X. Although we do not recommend it, it can be run on 
Microsoft WIndows NT, 2000 and XP.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 
<h3>Distribution of database services<br>
 </h3>
 GNUMed allows distributions of database services. Closely related information 
like a person's name and address are regarded as a "service", which may or 
may not be hosted on the same physical server as other services. Developers 
have to refer to the <a href="serviceslist.html">list of services</a> when 
designing database queries. A <i><b>central pivot database</b></i> provides 
information about the nature and whereabouts of distributed services. On the
client side, distribution is made transparent to the developer and end user
through a <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gnumed/gnumed/gnumed/client/python-common/gmPG.py?rev=HEAD&hideattic=1&search=None&diff_format=h&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup"><i><b>
database service broker</b></i></a> object which not only hides information
about service distribution, but can also be used for <i><b> load balancing</b></i>
, <i><b>reusable connections</b></i> and database replication in future versions.
<br>
 <br>

<h3>Normalization of data<br>
 </h3>
 Tables are <i><b>normalized</b></i> to the &nbsp;3rd normal form as long 
as this does not deteriorate query performance too much. In order to simplify 
client software development, a <b><i>pseudo-denormalization</i></b> is achieved 
through <i><b>updateable views</b></i>. Foreign key constraints ensure <i><b>
 referential integrity</b></i> of highly normalized data. Reference counter 
tables keep track of <i><b>cross-database relational integrity</b></i>, as 
PostgreSQL does not allow (yet) cross-database constraints and queries.<br>
 <br>
 
<h3>Audit trailing<br>
 </h3>
 <i><b>Trigger functions</b></i> ensure business logic and <i><b>audit trailing</b></i>
 . Deleting and updating of data is caught by triggers, and copies of the 
originals are kept in audit trail tables at all times. Database programmers 
need not to worry about this, as all audit trail related triggers and tables 
are generated automatically.&nbsp; In order to achieve this, we do use postgres 
specific extensions such as table inheritance and built-in procedural languages 
such as pgsql, pgtcl and pgpython. Thus, gnumed can not be easily ported to
a different database backend.<br>
 <br>
 
<h3>Access control</h3>
 The PostgreSQL server supports <i><b>secure authentication protocols</b></i>
  such as Kerberos as well as <i><b>secure communication ptrotocols</b></i>
 &nbsp; between client and server(s) such as SSL. In addition, data of more 
strictly confidential data wil be stored encrypted with arbitrary algorithms; 
although the cryptographic process is performed on the client side, this is
supported by the GNUMed server through a sophisticated key management. A
user hierarchy can be implemented, and access to tables and procedures can
be regulated through this hierarchy on the server side.<br>
 <br>
 
<h3>Multigenerational concurrency control and backups</h3>
 PostgreSQL uses a multigenerational concurrency control system. This not 
only avoids most locking situations, but also allows <i><b>life "snapshot" 
backups</b></i> of the complete database system while the system is running 
even under full load.<br>
