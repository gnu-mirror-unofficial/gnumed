<h2>Interacting with the Backend</h2>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
Most of the backend interaction happens through <a href="http://www.python.org/topics/database/DatabaseAPI-2.0.html">
DB-API 2.0</a> compliant database adapters. Since there are still a few ambiguities
in the API definition, and furthermore some important PostgreSQL specific
features not accessible via DB-API, we have decided to focus mainly on one
specific adaper: <a href="http://pypgsql.sourceforge.net/">PyPgSQL</a>. This
should not be a problem, since it is highly portable. We have succesfully
compiled it so far on different flavours of Linux and BSD, on different versions
of Windows, and on Mac OS/X.<br>
<br>
In order to understand how to access the backend in principle, you'll have
to understand the <a href="http://www.python.org/topics/database/DatabaseAPI-2.0.html">
DB-API specifications</a> first. You can find a brief generic introduction
<a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/writing/DB-API.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>
Next, you'll have to understand the concept of "<a href="serviceslist.html">
services</a>" in GnuMed. Fortunately, most of the complexity behind services
is handled by the service broker object <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gnumed/gnumed/gnumed/client/python-common/gmPG.py?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">
gmPG</a>. gmPG will also handle a lot of other complex issues such as gathering
log in information in order to make backend connections in the first place.<br>
<br>
PostgreSQL is fully transactional. Transactions (sequences of database modifications)
are only "committed" if the server is told so, otherwise the transactions
are rolled back (changes will not be visible in the database). Rollbacks
happen automatically if an error occurs during a transaction that may affect
the integrity of the database, but the rollback can also be initiated programmatically.&nbsp;
PostgreSQL "commits" happen on connection level. If a connection has several
active cursors (which it may at any time), a "commit" will affect all of
these cursors.<br>
<br>
Thus, in order not to interfere accidentally with other transactions, any
client action that modifies the backend database MUST request a separate
connection. However, establishing a connection is ressource intensive and
costs time, even if it is only milliseconds on a LAN. Since most of the database
interaction is typically read-only, where we don't have to fear transactional
collisions, we don't need to establish extra costly connections for the client
objecst that just want to read the database without modifying it.<br>
<br>
Since we want to make gnumed as resistant to programmatic errors as reasonably
possible, we have decided to make sure that write access will not happen
accidentally through a "read-only" connection. Unfortunately,PostgreSQL provides
no simple way of achieving this. Our current solution is that a pseudo-user
is created for each user; the user gets only read-only access, the pseudo-user
gets res &amp; write access. Once again, this is handled entirely transparent
by <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gnumed/gnumed/gnumed/client/python-common/gmPG.py?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">
gmPG</a>. If a read-only connection is requested, gmPG will return an open
connection from a pool of shared connections. If a writeable connection is
requested, gmPG opens a new connection under the alias of the pseudo-user
associated with the current user.<br>
<br>
For a practical example, let us assume we want to access a person's demographic
details. From the "<a href="serviceslist.html">services table</a>" we know
that this information is available through the service "personalia". Our
request for a read-only connection would look like this:<br>
<br>
<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" bgcolor="#ccffff">
      <pre>import gmPG<br>connection = gmPG.ConnectionPool().GetConnection("personalia")<br><br></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
That's all! If we are already logged in, gmPG will use the cached login information.
If not, gmPG will determine whether we are using a graphical user interface
and display a nice login dialogue, otherwise it will ask for login parameters
via command line. Then, gmPG will determine in which physical database the
service "personalia" is located, and return that connection.<br>
<br>
Now, we could already start doing something with the database. We could for
example get a list of all people who's surname begins with "H":<br>
<br>
<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#ccffff">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
      <pre>cursor = connection.cursor()<br>cursor.execute("Select * from v_basic_person where name like 'H%'" )<br>result = cursor.fetchall()<br></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
"result" will contain a list of "PgResultSet" objects, if there are any database
rows matching the search criteria. The PgResultSet is a most convenient object
wrapper which among other things allows us to address attributes by their
names:<br>
<br>
<table cellpadding="15" cellspacing="1" border="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#ccffff">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
      <pre>for&nbsp;person in result:<br>    print person['title'], person['firstnames'], person['lastnames'], person['dob']</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Of course, in most cases you would not query the database directly like that.
You would rather access the backend via classes derived from <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gnumed/gnumed/gnumed/client/python-common/gmDbObject.py?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">
gmDbObject</a> or at a even higher level through one of the cached database
objects.<br>
