<h2>The choice of software tools</h2>
<hr>
Software development often depends on specific software tools and third party software libraries.
<h3>Why it matters</h3>
The choice of tools and libraries strongly influences programming style, and thus maintainability and reusability 
of software.<br>
Not all developers are equally comfortable with all tools. Being able to recruit suitable
developers is often a matter of providing the right tools. Development speed can depend
significantly on the choice of tools. 
Some vendors abuse software tools as a mechanism of implementing vendor lock-in even if the tools
are used for open standard programming languages. These tools typically enforce tool-specific programming
styles, making it very difficult to migrate to different tools for the same purpose (Example:
MS Visual Studio).<br>
<p>
Licensing and source code availability of third party software libraries is a most important issue that 
is commonly overlooked: the wrong license and unavailability of source code can render a whole project
unreusable and unmaintainable unless significant further development costs are spent on replacing these
third party libraries.
</p>
<h3>Learning from past mistakes</h3>
It is worth mentioning that two of the major Australian software projects are said to suffer 
difficulties with product adoption and project progress because of their choice of software tools 
and libraries:
<ul>
	<li>The "Argus" project is using Borland's "JBuilder", a proprietary integrated development tool
	which encourages use of non-standard third party libraries (namely Borland's own). This has alienated 
	them from volunteers from the free software community who could have helped to reduce development
	costs and accelerated the testing/debugging cycles significantly. Use of these libraries also results in lesser
	flexibility and doubtful long term maintainability.
	</li>
	<li>The "GEHR" project has chosen to rely on proprietary extensions and class libraries to the
	Eiffel language - a language which itself is not used very often in the first place, despite it's
	doubtless merits. The initial implementation relied on a proprietary object database module ("POET")
	which made it impossible for the community to test the product and to get used to it that way. The
	costs associated with the chosen tools made it impossible for volunteers to join development -
	volunteers who would have been crucial for a chronically under funded project</li>
</ul>

<h3>General requirements for software tools and other third party software</h3>

It should be a general requirement that
<ul>
	<li>no specific development tool should be allowed unless it is replaceable with at least one other software tool of
	which the long term availability is guaranteed. The latter applies obviously only to tools where the source 
	code is available.<br>
	Example: A developer may chose the proprietary "Microsoft Visual C++" as development tool as long
	as he produces ANSI compliant C++ code and portable makefiles
	</li>
	<li>no third party code should be allowed unless it's license allows full transferable ownership and
	full availability of source code. Third party libraries should not compromise portability</li>
	<li>before any decisions are made regarding software tools and libraries, extensive research on
	available free tools and libraries should be performed. Not knowing about existing time proven
	free tools and libraries has wasted fortunes (Example: HeSA's decision to purchase cryptographic
	modules despite availability of free fully tested cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Portability considerations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Without very good reason, code has to be written in a portable way</li>
	<li>Whenever features require platform specific implementation, platform specific details
	have to be isolated via abstract interfaces so that porting can be achieved with least 
	possible effort</li>
	<li>Before such self written abstraction is taken into consideration, extensive research
	should be undertaken regarding available cross platform tool kits</li>
	<li>Wherever possible, core functionality should be implemented without any graphical user
	interface</li>
	<li>Wherever graphical user interfaces are necessary, the user interface part has to be
	cleanly separated from application logic</li>
	<li>Graphical user interfaces have to be implemented with portable interface toolkits</li>
	<li>These requirements are recursive: they apply to any tools and libraries used</li>
</ul>
Portability is usually affected by the following issues:
<ul>
	<li>file system access</li>
	<li>spawning and handling child / parallel processes</li>
	<li>networking</li>
	<li>inter-application interaction / remote procedure calls</li>
	<li>user interface, both graphical or text mode</li>
	<li>device interfacing (sound, 3D acceleration, printing etc)</li>
	<li>end user software installation</li>
</ul>
Fortunately, most high level languages nowadays have standard libraries taking care
of many of these issues. The general exception are graphical user interfaces - only Java 
appears to provide a consistent portable graphical user interface through it's standard libraries.
However, this at the expense of platform-native "look & feel" - an issue many users dislike,
but also an issue that leads to inconsistent behaviour on most platforms when interacting with
non-Java applications. (Example: cut & paste handling, standard dialogues for file
selection and error handling, short cuts). The other exception is device interfacing.

<h3>Available portable toolkits and third party libraries</h3>
The following list of available free software tools is a suggestion only, to serve 
as an example and starting point. As the list of recommended programming languages before,
it is far from exhaustive but tries to cover the most common choices.
<p>
Essential criteria are:
<ul>
	<li>availability on as many platforms as possible. At least covering Windows, Linux and Apple
	MacIntosh</li>
	<li>ease of use</li>
	<li>availability of quality documentation</li>
	<li>royalty free distribution of developed software</li>
	<li>source code availability to ensure long term maintainability and reusability</li>
</ul>
