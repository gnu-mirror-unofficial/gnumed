<h2>The choice of language</h2>
<hr>
<H3>Why it matters:</H3>
Software is written in human readable "computer languages". Some of these languages
are standardized and well defined (Examples: C, C++, Pascal). Others are proprietary 
(MS Visual Basic). Few languages are somewhere in between, like Java, where a single 
vendor instead of a standards body reserves the right of defining which implementation 
is valid.
<p>Generally spoken, proprietary languages are to be avoided: they are unlikely to
have any longevity suitable for long term software maintenance, they are usually not
available on a variety of platforms, and they generally lead to vendor lock-in</p>
<p>The choice of computer language for any one project is very important. It will
determine the time span code will remain reuseable if useable at all. It will determine
how well a module will integrate with modules written in other languages, and it will
most certainly determine portability. The likelihood of attracting skilled developers
at reasonable costs entirely depends on the choice of programming language - a factor
which is often ignored when starting a project.</p>

<h3>Which language for what purpose?</h3>
<p>Not all languages serve equally well for all purposes. It is not always possible to
limit any one project to one programming language only. It is generally accepted that the
use of very high level programming languages leads to faster development cycles, better
reusability of components, and more robust end products. However, performance or hardware 
specific parts often depend on so called low level languages. It is therefore important to 
not only select "good" languages, but also to pay attention as to how well the chosen languages
will interact and integrate</p>

<p>Following table provides a small selection of programming languages particularly suitable for 
publicly funded projects</p>

Legend:<br>
<ul>
  <li>level: refers to level of abstraction. The higher the level, the
faster the development and the more robust ("bug free") the resulting
code.</li>
  <li>portability: refers to both availability of development tools on
different platforms as well as portability of source code across
platforms</li>
  <li>ease of use: closely related to the level of a language, but
taking ease of learning, readability of source code and
auto documentation features into account</li>
  <li>performance: typical execution speed of a variety of tasks</li>
  <li>popularity: likelihood of a programming language to be known and
used by an average programmer<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A few languages which might appear suitable at first glance have been left out on purpose:
<ul>
	<li><b>Perl:</b> while the Perl language is highly popular among web developers and text 
	processing script writers, it has often rightfully been described as "read only" language.
	Perl does not encourage writing readable source code, and thus makes cooperation on 
	larger projects very difficult. Wherever Perl is suggested, it should be replaced by Python or PHP
	in order to facilitate code readability and maintainability. </li>
	<li><b>Smalltalk:</b> not widely implemented, very resource hungry, few developers using it</li>
	<li><b>MS Visual Basic:</b> while both popular and easy to learn, it is entirely unportable and has a very
	uncertain future.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>C++</b> is certainly a good choice for most software projects due to it's popularity, excellent
performance and availability of vast libraries. However, since it does not enjoy the same degree of
abstraction as other proposed languages, development is likely to take longer and cost significantly more
than development with higher level languages.</p>
<p>While <b>Java</b> often seems a good candidate for portable publicly funded software project, SUN's stronghold
on the language in the context of SUN's unclear future together with a wildly growing complexity
of libraries without backwards compatibility make Java increasingly less future proof. However, it is still
often preferred in academic environments, and there is no shortage of Java capable developers. The main
benefit is probably a stable standardized cross platform user interface library, which at the same
time is a major drawback when users lack the "look and feel" they are accustomed to from their
preferred platform</p>
<p><b>Eiffel</b> could be an ideal language if it would not suffer from vendor driven library incompatibilities and 
lack of developers with Eiffel knowledge. Due to the lack of popularity, there is also a lack of
generally available libraries, though this problem can be overcome by wrapping C/C++ libraries for Eiffel</p>
<p><b>PHP</b> is probably best suited for web projects, the domain where it enjoys greatest popularity anyway. While 
it is available as general purpose interpreted language, it cannot match Python in terms of performance,
ease of use, robustness and readability of code for that purpose</p>
<p>In my opinion, <b>Python</b> offers the best balance of all desirable features. There is a plethora of robust
high level libraries for most common problems including cross platform user interface toolkits providing a 
native "look ad feel" on most platforms. Performance bottlenecks can be solved by either writing 
performance sensitive parts in C or C++, or by writing the main stub in C/C++ and then embedding Python.It 
is worth mentioning that one version of Python called "Jython" has been implemented entirely in Java, 
allowing easy integration of Python and Java modules and full access to all Java libraries from Python.</p> 
<p><b>Python</b> is one of the few "pure academic" languages apart from Pascal that made it into the mainstream. Despite
no commercial entity backing it up officially, it's popularity has increased in an explosive way. Serious 
business such as the NASA, the web search engine Google and the National Institute of Health 
use Python for critical tasks. An increasing number of "programming gurus" favour Python 
(Quoting Bruce Eckel [9], author of the best selling text books 
"Thinking in C++" and "Thinking in Java": "Considering that Python is my language of choice for virtually 
all my own programming projects, my research into the language is continuing apace"[27]. Or, quoting another
IT icon, Eric S. Raymond: "For anything larger or more complex, I have come to prefer the subtle virtues 
of Python -- and I think you will, too." [9])</p>
