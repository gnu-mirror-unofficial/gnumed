<H1>Guidelines for health software purchase and
contracting in the context of government subsidised projects</H1>

<P>The benefits of computerized health records are indisputable, and
further benefits are expected from the implementation of computerized
decision support. However, current systems are only implementing a
small fraction of the potential benefits. The government has been
called upon to finance development of software projects aiming at
improving health outcome and saving costs to the health system.</P>
<P>However, there are no guidelines as to which projects to support,
under what conditions. So far, ?? Australian taxpayers dollars have
been spent on ?? projects, arguably without any major tangible
outcome. While each project in itself may have its merits, the lack
of interoperability and reuseability reduced the long term benefits
of such software close to zero. Since virtually all projects
purchased or commissioned software without getting access to its
source code, that software cannot even serve for learning purposes
for our upcoming generations of health informaticians. We may conclude 
that most of the project money spent so far on software has been wasted.</P>
<P>Current common practice is to put a software project to tender,
and have a small set of end user specfications implemented by a
vendor. Typically, implementation details are not specified and
source code remains property of the vendor. Even in the few cases 
where the public ownership of the source code
was specified in the contract, the tender missed to specify that avalability
of source code needs to extend to 3rd party libraries and all non-replaceable 
software tools. (The software must be extensible and maintainable without
any requirements for proprietary 3rd party libraries or tools).
</p>
<p>
In the worst case,
monopolies are fostered by the choice of vendors which misuse such
publically funded projects in order to lock customer into their
proprietary solutions, effecively not only depriving customers of a
choice but also choking the competition which might have been able to
offer better alternatives in the future. 'Once a customer is &quot;locked
into&quot; proprietary software, its makers can demand premium
prices, safe in the knowledge that the client would find it even more
expensive to change' [1,2]</P>
<p>It is also essential to involve clinicians throughout all phases of planning and
decision making regarding health related software:<br>
"Health care IT is led almost exclusively 
by commercial vendors and health care corporate management information services (MIS) 
departments. There is a poverty of clinician leadership.<br>
Even medical informaticists, clinicians ideally qualified to provide such leadership, 
often find themselves poorly accepted in vendor and MIS shops. This may be due to 
territorial issues, cultural differences, and methodological differences. 
One such methodological difference is <b><i>the clinician's favoring of a participatory 
approach to application development</i></b>, which represents a significant departure from 
traditional information system design.This may make those in industry or MIS uncomfortable." 
[25,26]</p>
<P>In order to maxmize benefits from publicly funded software, a
minimum policy should be implemented. This document is aiming at
providing a rationale for such a policy.</P>
<hr>
<H2>Features desirable for all software projects</H2>
	<h3>Interoperability:</h3>
	in health informatics, there will
	rarely be a case where a specific piece of software will be useful
	in isolation. In virtually all cases, maximum benefit can be
	achieved by integrating software modules into a larger architecture. <br>
	To that purpose, software needs to be designed modular with well
	defined interfaces. It is desirable to achieve interoperability across
	different platforms; for that purpose, only open standards for 
	inter-component communication should be used
	<h3>Reusability:</h3>
	In order to maximise reusability, the source code 
	has to be open and portable. This will not only allow other developers to 
	benefit from an already existing code base and thus decrease costs of 
	future projects, but it will also allow students to learn from an existing
	code base. It will facilitate an evolutionary development process which is
	likely to lead to better code quality and interoperability as well. Having to 
	"reinvent the wheel" repeatedly is counterproductive. Open and portable code
	will prevent both vendor lock-in as well as vendor driven premature obsolescence.
	<h3>Standard compliance:</h3>
	Whenever useable standards exist, no attempt should be made at using or even developing 
	a proprietary 
	solution instead. Should existing standards not cover the needs completely, it is
	preferrable to extend existing standards or, even better, to influence the
	standard body to adopt proposed extensions into a new revision of that standard.
<br>

<h2>The 6 steps towards a good software tender</h2>
In order to achieve the goals of interoperability, reusability, and standard compliance 
the contract needs to be drafted accordingly. Of course, all common contract issues such as 
goal specifications, budget,default handling etc. need to be considered. This is usually no problem,
since anybody used to drafting contracts will know how to do this.<br>
However, in the case of publicly funded software, there are a few extra requirements that are essential
as well: no contract should be put to tender which doesn't specify in detail <i>all</i> of the following
issues:
<ol>
	<li><b>Which license for the end product?</b><br>
	The license will ultimately determine the long term value of any software
	</li>
	<li><b>What platform shall be supported?</b><br>
	It is unwise to restrict the choice of platform artificially without good reason.
	</li>
	<li><b>What programming languages and software tools can be used?</b><br>
	The choice of development tools has a major impact on interoperability and reusability 
	</li>
	<li><b>What API and/or RPC interface is to be used?</b><br>
	Standardised APIs and RPC interfaces will increase interoperability
	and reuseability dramatically.
	</li>
	<li><b>Which existing components are to be reused or extended?</b><br>
	Reuse of existing components fosters standards and saves money
	</li>
	<li><b>What standards are to be used?</b><br>
	The choice of standard is essential for interoperability
	</li>
</ol>
The rest of this document intends to clarify these six core issues. It will be highlighted why these
issues are important, and advice will be given regarding relevant software contract specifications.

<hr>

<H2>The choice of license</H2>

<H3>Why it matters:</H3>
	The license will
	ultimately determine who will benefit from a software product. When a
	project is put to tender spending public money, a license should be
	chosen that will maximise the taxpayers benefit.
	
<H3>What different licensing schemes are available?	</h3>
<ol>
	<LI><b>'closed source' licensing scheme:</b> The contractor preserves all rights on the software and
	sells licenses to the end user. The end user has no rights nor
	possibility to modify the software. There are three possible
	alternatives, each with an optional escrow clause:
	
	<OL>
		<LI> <b>purchase scheme:</b> the user pays once for unlimited rights of use as
		outlined in the software purchase contract.
		The user has no rights of redistribution nor modification
		<LI><b>subscription scheme:</b> the user has
		rights of use for a determined period of time, after which the he
		has to renew the license or cease usage
		<LI><b>closed source public domain release:</b> the user has unlimited 
		rights of use and redistribution, but no facilities for modifying, porting,
		or improving the software.
	</OL>
	<br>
	<li><b>source escrow:</b> the vendor deposits
	the source code and developer documentation with a trusted third
	party. The licensing agreement determines when and under which 
	conditions this source code is to be released. Otherwise, this
	license works as the closed source licensing schemes
	</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>open source licensing:</b>
	the contractor has to surrender intellectual property, but may
	retain copyright. There is a large number of possible schemes.
	Examples for often used or discussed schemes are:
	<ol>
		<LI><b>BSD style license:</b>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, 
		with or without modification, are permitted provided that a number of conditions are met,
		often including an advertising clause
		</li>
		<LI><b>GPL style license:</b> the copyright
		remains with the original owner, but the user is granted all rights
		to modify and redistribute the software under the provison that
		derived/redistributed products and/or products using this software
		in any other direct way are licensed under the same
		licensing scheme.</li>
		<LI><b>LGPL style license:</b> basically the
		same as GPL, but this license is not 'contagious': it requires same
		licensing (LGPL) only for derivatives or direct redistributions.</P>
		<LI><b>'shared source':</b> some or all of the source code is released
		in a discriminative way, but the vendor prohibits any
		modifications or redistribution.</P>
	</ol>
</ol>
<h3>Advantages of closed source licenses:</h3>
for the customer, there are none at all, since any perceived
advantage is also available for open source licenses as well. 
An exeption wold be a slightly lower initial purchasing cost if
the vendor intends to resell the software to multiple oher customers.
However, this usually marginal cost reduction is almost always offset
by the lost investment factor, since such software cannot be reused or 
extended. Hence, all advantages of closed source software are unilaterally 
with the vendor. Thus, it is not in the taxpayers
interest to invest in closed source software.
<h3>Disadvantages of closed source software licenses:</h3>
Closed source software is typically limited to only one
platform or a small number of platforms. The end user is deprived of
choice regarding hardware and operating system. Problems arise with
virtually any hard-and/or software upgrade where the user is at the
mercy of the vendor who may or may not provide a suitable upgrade.
There is ample evidence of the disastrous consequences of closed
source software licensing for large scale governmental projects
[1...]

<P>Further problems arise when it comes to
system integration. Typically, closed source software lacks well
defined APIs or RPC interfaces that would facilitate integration.
Should the need for integration arise, there is no option for the
licensee to implement the neccessary changes.Even where such API
or RPC interface exists, the fact that it cannot be modified pre-programs
artefactual obsolescence which cannot be in the interest of the user
</P>
<P>Closed source software also stiffles
and distorts competition, since competitors will suffer from the same
restrictions as the licensee, and thus will be unable to provide a
customer with a better / distinctive service for that particular
product.
</P>
<p>While Microsoft's proposal of "shared code" will allow limited
peer review of security sensitive code and, under certain circumstances, also
allow implementation of interfaces, it is generally regarded as a mere
publicity stunt without any real benefit to the customer [7]</p>

<h3>Advantages of open source licenses</h3>
At first glance all advantages appear to be with the customer, who can 
<ul>
<li>inspect the code for errors and specification compliance</li>
<li>reuse or extend the code for related projects</li>
<li>contract a different vendor/developer for further development
or ongoing maintenance when need arises</li>
<li>scrutinize the code for security loopholes</li>
<li>port the code to different platforms</li>
</ul>
However, there are also numerous benefits to vendors:
<ul>
<li>they can benefit too from an existing pool of open sourced modules</li>
<li>they can prove compliance with specifications and security demands</li>
<li>small business will have equal opportunities for tasks adequate to the 
business size: not all vendors see competition negative</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disdvantages of open source licenses</h3>
The main disadvantage is for the vendor, since he cannot exert vendor lock-in
maneuvres with open source software. Open source licensing effectively
breaks monopolies. However, for the customer this is always an advantage.
<p>People unfamiliar with IT security might perceive open code as an invitation
for hackers; those without in depth security knowledge often assume that
obscurity can provide security. This assumption has been proven wrong repeatedly.
It is now commonly accepted in professional circles that peer review is a
requirement for security. It is no coincidence that closed source companies
like Microsoft have a disastrous security record track.</p>
<p>Purchasing the full so called intellectual property in the form of source code
might incur extra costs. These extra costs need to be weighed against the expected benefits.
As a rule of thumb one might expect that minor projects require that little funding that
the extra costs are too small to matter, and large projects would cost too much anyway
to allow a lost investment in the form of closed source software, so that again the extra 
costs (if any) for the disclosure of the source code would be worthwile in the long term</p>
<h3>Recommendation regarding choice of software licensing scheme:</h3>
The recommendation to be made is clear:
<i>closed source licensing schemes are to be avoided</i>. They are generally
unacceptable in security sensitive applications since they do not allow peer
review. Closed source software is more often than not a lost investment, since
it can rarely be reused or extended nor adapted when interoperability requires it.
Even if purchasing the source code and related rights might cost more initially, 
this one off cost is likely to be more than balanced by the long term benefits.

<h2>The choice of language</h2>
<H3>Why it matters:</H3>
Software is written in human readable "computer languages". Some of these languages
are standardized and well defined (Examples: C, C++, Pascal). Others are proprietary 
(MS Visual Basic). Few languages are somewhere in between, like Java, where a single 
vendor instead of a standards body reserves the right of defining which implementation 
is valid.
<p>Generally spoken, proprietary languages are to be avoided: they are unlikely to
have any longevity suitable for long term software maintenance, they are usually not
available on a variety of platforms, and they generally lead to vendor lock-in</p>
<p>The choice of computer language for any one project is very important. It will
determine the time span code will remain reuseable if useable at all. It will determine
how well a module will integrate with modules written in other languages, and it will
most certainly determine portability. The likelihood of attracting skilled developers
at reasonable costs entirely depends on the choice of programming language - a factor
which is often ignored when starting a project.</p>

<h3>Which language for what purpose?</h3>
<p>Not all languages serve equally well for all purposes. It is not always possible to
limit any one project to one programming language only. It is generally accepted that the
use of very high level programming languages leads to faster development cycles, better
reusability of components, and more robust end products. However, performance or hardware 
specific parts often depend on so called low level languages. It is therefore important to 
not only select "good" languages, but also to pay attention as to how well the chosen languages
will interact and integrate</p>

<p>Following table provides a small selection of programming languages particularly suitable for 
publicly funded projects</p>

Legend:<br>
<ul>
  <li>level: refers to level of abstraction. The higher the level, the
faster the development and the more robust ("bug free") the resulting
code.</li>
  <li>portability: refers to both availability of development tools on
different platforms as well as portability of source code across
platforms</li>
  <li>ease of use: closely related to the level of a language, but
taking ease of learning, readability of source code and
autodocumentation features into account</li>
  <li>performance: typical execution speed of a variety of tasks</li>
  <li>popularity: likelihood of a programming language to be known and
used by an average programmer<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A few languages which might appear suitable at first glance have been left out on purpose:
<ul>
	<li><b>Perl:</b> while the Perl language is highly popular among web developers and text 
	processing script writers, it has often rightfully been described as "read only" language.
	Perl does not encourage writing readable source code, and thus makes cooperation on 
	larger projects very difficult. Wherever Perl is suggested, it should be replaced by Python or PHP
	in order to facilitate code readabilty and maintainability. </li>
	<li><b>Smalltalk:</b> not widely implemented, very ressource hungry, few developers using it</li>
	<li><b>MS Visual Basic:</b> while both popular and easy to learn, it is entirely unportable and has a very
	uncertain future.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>C++</b> is certainly a good choice for most software projects due to it's popularity, excellent
performance and availability of vast libraries. However, since it does not enjoy the same degree of
abstraction as other proposed languages, development is likely to take longer and cost significantly more
than development with higher level languages.</p>
<p>While <b>Java</b> often seems a good candidate for portable publicly funded software project, SUN's stronghold
on the language in the context of SUN's unclear future together with a wildly growing complexity
of libraries without backwards compatibility make Java increasingly less future proof. However, it is still
often preferred in academic environments, and there is no shortage of Java capable developers. The main
benefit is probably a stable standardized cross platform user interface library, which at the same
time is a major drawback when users lack the "look and feel" they are accustomed to from their
preferred platform</p>
<p><b>Eiffel</b> could be an ideal language if it would not suffer from vendor driven library incompatibilities and 
lack of developers with Eiffel knowledge. Due to the lack of popularity, there is also a lack of
generally available libraries, though this problem can be overcome by wrapping C/C++ libraries for Eiffel</p>
<p><b>PHP</b> is probably best suited for web projects, the domain where it enjoys greatest popularity anyway. While 
it is available as general purpose interpreted language, it cannot match Python in terms of performance,
ease of use, robustness and readability of code for that purpose</p>
<p>In my opinion, <b>Python</b> offers the best balance of all desirable features. There is a plethora of robust
high level libraries for most common problems including cross platform user interface toolkits providing a 
native "look ad feel" on most platforms. Performance bottlenecks can be solved by either writing 
performance sensitive parts in C or C++, or by writing the main stub in C/C++ and then embedding Python.It 
is worth mentioning that one version of Python called "Jython" has been implemented entirely in Java, 
allowing easy integration of Python and Java modules and full access to all Java libraries from Python.</p> 
<p><b>Python</b> is one of the few "pure academic" languages apart from Pascal that made it into the mainstream. Despite
no commercial entity backing it up officially, it's popularity has increased in an explosive way. Serious 
business such as the NASA, the web search engine Google and the National Institute of Health 
use Python for critical tasks. An increasing number of "programming gurus" favour Python 
(Quoting Bruce Eckel [9], author of the best selling text books 
"Thinking in C++" and "Thinking in Java": "Considering that Python is my language of choice for virtually 
all my own programming projects, my research into the language is continuing apace"[27]. Or, quoting another
IT icon, Eric S. Raymond: "For anything larger or more complex, I have come to prefer the subtle virtues 
of Python -- and I think you will, too." [9])</p>

<h2>The choice of software tools</h2>
Software development often depends on specific software tools and third party software libraries.
<h3>Why it matters</h3>
The choice of tools and libraries strongly influences programming style, and thus maintainability and reusability 
of software.<br>
Not all developers are equally comfortable with all tools. Being able to recruite suitable
developers is often a matter of providing the right tools. Development speed can depend
significantly on the choice of tools. 
Some vendors abuse software tools as a mechanism of imementig vendor lock-in even if the tools
are used for open standard programming languages. These tools typically enforce tool-specific programming
styles, making it very difficult to migrate to different tools for the same purpose (Example:
MS Visual Studio).<br>
<p>
Licensing and source code availability of third party software libraries is a most important issue that 
is commonly overlooked: the wrong license and unavaibility of source code can render a whole project
unreusable and unmaintainable unless significant further deelopment costs are spent on replacing these
third party libraries.
</p>
<h3>Learning from past mistakes</h3>
It is worth mentioning that two of the major Australian software projects are said to suffer 
difficulties with product adoption and project progress because of their choice of software tools 
and libraries:
<ul>
	<li>The "Argus" project is using Borland's "JBuilder", a proprietary integrated development tool
	which encourages use of non-standard third party libraries (namely Borland's own). This has alienated 
	them from volunteers from the free software community who could have helped to reduce development
	costs and accelerated the testing/debugging cyclus significantly. Use of these libraries also results in lesser
	flexibility and doubtful long term maintainability.
	</li>
	<li>The "GEHR" project has chosen to rely on proprietary extensions and class libraries to the
	Eiffel language - a language which itself is not used very often in the first place, despite it's
	doubtless merits. The initial implementation relied on a propritary object database module ("POET")
	which made it impossible for the community to test the product and to get used to it that way. The
	costs associated with the chosen tools made it impossible for volunteers to join development -
	volunteers who would have been crucial for a chronically underfunded project</li>
</ul>

<h3>General requirements for software tools and other third party software</h3>

It should be a general requirement that
<ul>
	<li>no specific development tool should be allowed unless it is replaceable with at least one other software tool of
	which the long term availability is guaranteed. The latter applies obviously only to tools where the source 
	code is available.<br>
	Example: A developer may chose the proprietary "Microsoft Visual C++" as development tool as long
	as he produces ANSI compliant C++ code and portable makefiles
	</li>
	<li>no third party code should be allowed unless it's license allows full transferable ownership and
	full availability of source code. Third party libraries should not compromise portability</li>
	<li>before any decisions are made regarding software tools and libraries, extensive research on
	available free tools and libraries should be performed. Not knowing about existing time proven
	free tools and librares has wasted fortunes (Example: HeSA's decision to purchase cryptographic
	modules despite avialbility of free fully tested cryprographic libraries such as OpenSSL)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Portability considerations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Without very good reason, code has to be written in a portable way</li>
	<li>Whenever features require platform specific implementation, platform specific details
	have to be isolated via abstract interfaces so that portig can be achieved with least 
	possible effort</li>
	<li>Before such self written abstraction is taken into consideration, extensive research
	should be undertaken regarding available cross platform tool kits</li>
	<li>Wherever possible, core functionality should be implemented without any graphical user
	interface</li>
	<li>Wherever graphical user interfaces are neccessary, the user interface part has to be
	cleanly separated from application logic</li>
	<li>Graphical user interfaces have to be implememted with portable interface toolkits</li>
	<li>These requirements are recursive: they apply to any tools and libraries used</li>
</ul>
Portability is usually affected by the following issues:
<ul>
	<li>file system access</li>
	<li>spawning and handling child / parallel processes</li>
	<li>networking</li>
	<li>inter-application interaction / remote procedure calls</li>
	<li>user interface, both graphical or text mode</li>
	<li>device interfacing (sound, 3D acceleration, printing etc)</li>
	<li>end user software installation</li>
</ul>
Fortunately, most high level languages nowaday have standard libraries taking care
of many of these issues. The general exception are graphical user interfaces - only Java 
appears to provide a consistent portable graphical user interface through it's standard libraries.
However, this at the expense of platform-native "look & feel" - an issue many users dislike,
but also an issue that leads to inconsistent behaviour on most platforms when interacting with
non-Java applications. (Example: cut & paste handling, standard dialogues for file
selection and error handling, short cuts). The other exception is device interfacing.

<h3>Available portable toolkits and third party libraries</h3>
The following list of available free software tools is a suggestion only, to serve 
as an example and starting point. As the list of recommended programming languages before,
it is far from exhaustive but tries to cover the most common choices.
<p>
Essential criteria are:
<ul>
	<li>availability on as many platforms as possible. At least covering Windows, Linux and Apple
	MacIntosh</li>
	<li>ease of use</li>
	<li>availability of quality documentation</li>
	<li>royalty free distribution of developed software</li>
	<li>source code availability to ensure long term maintainability and reusability</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Portable graphical user interface toolkits</h4>
Generally, they should
<ul>
	<li>provide a native look & feel on each platform</li>
	<li>interact with "native" applications in the expected way</li>
	<li>not impact negatively on performance</li>
	<li>be available for a variety of programming languages</li>
</ul>
A graphical user interface design tool is desirable. It is even more desirable if such design tool
allows clean separation from user interface design and code, allowing to modify user interface
details without having to adjust code manually.

	  GUI toolkits, usually less than 50% of the code neccessary to achieve the same goal as compared to
	  Microsoft's MFC or Motif. Decreases complexity of source code and thus increases development
	  speed considerably as compared to most toolkits. Unfortunately, it is only free on Unix/X11, and then 
	  only if software developed with it is released under GPL license.<br>
	  However, developer licenses are modestly priced and since no royalties are required, QT licenses
	  are a worthwhile investment.

<h3>Conclusion portable GUI tools:</h3>
The most mature and versatile toolkit is probably <a href="#QT">QT</a>. The two main drawbacks are 
that achieveing "native look & feel" sometimes requires some tweaking (can be done by the installation
procedure so that the end user needs not get confronted with this) and that a free GPL version is
only available for Unix/X11. However, any budget that can afford a few thousand dollars for 
developer licenses, will not see any problem in this. Volunteers can simply develop on Linux using
the free GPL version - since the QT code is identical on all platforms, this is no impediment. 
<p>
Small utilities where size matters and limitation to C++ as language is no problem are
probably best served by using <a href="#FLTK">FLTK</a>. It does away with bloat, and its suitability
for static linking allows production of single-file binaries without any external library
dependencies - something appreciated by most users
</p>
<p>
Projects where the license restriction of QT matters and where native look & feel is absolutely
crucial, are best served by using <a href="#wxWindows">wxWindows or wxPython</a>. This toolkit is robust and feature rich, and
since it is just an API to native implementations on each platform it does not only look and feel
"native", it <b>is</b> native. Similar to QT, wxWindows is entering the embedded market, making porting
to handhelds easy.
</p>
<p>The <a href="#GTK">GTK</a> toolkit, while one of the most used GUI toolkits used in the free software domain, unfortunately 
still lacks the professional Windows support that would be neccessary to recommend it yet for true
cross platform development</p>
<p>There is a vast choice of portable GUI tools available, both free and commercial, that
have not been mentioned. A popular choice in the Windows world - <b>MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes)</b>- has not been mentioned since it 
is entirely unportable. While excellent RAD tools exist for MFC, most of these tools make it
difficult to separate GUI from application logic. They encourage and sometimes even enforce a sloppy and 
unportable programming style, effectively locking developers into a specific tool once complexity
of a project has exceeded a certain limit. Thus, we would strongly advise against graphical
user interfaces developed using MFC.</p>
<p>Another popular choice is <b>TK, Tcl's toolkit</b>. It is one of the most ported graphical user interface
toolkits ever. Interfaces exist for most other languages as well, and currently it is still the 
"official standard" cross platform GUI interface for Python. It's main drawback is a feature poor standard widget set (if not using 3rd party 
extensions) as well as poor performance due to it's string based messenging and parameter architecture.</p>
<p><b>Java's "Swing"</b> should probably have deserved a detailed review as well. It is feature rich,
powerful and truly portable. Language bindings for languages other than Java exist, such as for
Python. However, we are not the only ones getting negative feedback from 
users regarding slow performance and complete lack of native "look and feel". Since end user acceptance 
ranks very high on our priority list, the use of "Swing" should initially be reserved for applications
that are mainly used by IT professionals who do not mind the lack of native "look and feel"</p>
<hr>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
In order to maximize the benefit obtained for taxpayers money, any software contract should
clarify the following on top of the usual project specifications:
<ol>
	<li><b>choice of license:</b> preferrably GPL</li>
	<li><b>choice of architecture:</b> modular portable design</li>
	<li><b>choice of platform:</b> preferrably portable, no unneccessary platform restrictions</li>
	<li><b>choice of language:</b> preferrably a high level, open standard language 
	(Examples: Python, Eiffel, C++, (Java), PHP) whenever hardware and performance allow it</li>
	<li><b>choice of tools:</b> preferrably no need for proprietary tools 
	(use of proprietary tools for convenience is allowable as long as these tools are not indispensible
	for building, maintaining or extending this software )</li>
	<li><b>choice of interface:</b> well formulated API, and preferrably standard cross platform interfaces
	and protocols like XML-RPC, SOAP or CORBA</li>
	<li><b>choice of standards:</b> whenever any aspect of the software can be implemented through 
	or make use of an approved standard, this standard has to be used</li>
	<li><b>choice of 3rd party software / toolkits:</b> Existing software modules that comply with all 
	of the above should be reused, extended or modified in preference to re-developing. Software products
	not compliant with the stated specifications should no be used at all.</li>
