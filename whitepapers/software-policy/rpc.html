<h2>Inter process communication and remote procedure calls</h2>
<hr>
Stability and maintainability of software decreases with complexity. Complexity increases with
the number of source code lines. In order to decrease complexity and increase stability,
maintainability and reuseability, software is broken into modules.
<br>A modular software architecture requires modules to communicate with each other. 
This communication can happen at different levels: 
<h3>Direct linking and shared memory</h3>
<i>Analogy for non-programmers: if a program would be a book, linked modules would be chapters 
in that book. Statically linked modules would equal to chapters bound together to a single 
volume, dynamically linked modules would be more akin with a book broken down into separate 
volumes. In either case, information is confined to one or more bound volumes</i>
<p>
In the simplest case, modules are just linked together using the same address space. 
This linkage can happen statically or dynamically. Sharing the same address space is
very efficient in terms of performance. However, it limits the benefit of the modules
used to a single machine - often even to a single process on that single machine.<br>
Static linkage produces monolithic applications with the advantage of simple maintenance: 
the end user does not need to worry about module interdependencies. Dynamic linkage can
be more gentle to ressources, but it makes program maintenance more demanding.<br>
This most basic form of modularity is useful to break up complexity within the context of 
a self-contained application, and should be used whenever performance is crucial. This 
level of modularity is helpful for breaking down complexity and reusing the most basic
components. It should be used for any components that could serve an independent
purpose, like component libraries for specific algorithms and datastructures.
</p>
<h3>Piping and domain sockets</h3>
<i>Analogy for non-programmers: sticking to our book analogy, think of this level of abstraction as a
library: many books in one room, and you can freely cross-reference information as long
as you stay in the library room.</i> 
<p>
The next level of modularity is achieved when independent applications communicate with each 
other within the same machine: "pipelining", that is redirecting output of one program as input 
for the next program is the classic Unix way. Small modules doing one simple task very well 
are put to work in concert to achieve a complex task. This input/output redirection can happen
via standard input / output as plain text, or via domain sockets (operating system dependent
communication channels). Standard I/O piping can be portable, domain sockets are usually
not. I/O piping works in non-multitasking environments, domain sockets require several
processes running in parallel.<br> 
This level of modularity gives independence of programming language. It should be used for 
any component that can serve a purpose independently ("stand-alone utilities") where communication
across a network is not neccessary.
</p>
<h3>Remote procedure calls and Distributed Objects</h3>
<i>Analogy for non-programmers: this level of modularity would represent inter-library book loan:
you are not confined to the capacity of your own library any more, but for the benefit of having
access to greater ressources you pay a penalty by having to wait until the books arrive
</i>
<p>A special case of this level of modularity would be any client-server architecture, with
or without middleware.</p>
<p>
The highest abstraction level of inter process communication is achieved when it becomes irrelevant 
where within a network a module is located, in what language it is written and on what platform it runs. 
Communicating between different machines requires some protocol to ensure that data arrives at its 
destination as intended in a format that is understood by both parties, and often some form of authentication
is neccessary to ensure that the recipient is the intended one too. 
</p>
<p>When chosing a method of inter process communication at the level of RPC or distributed objects, 
it is important to consider 
<ul>
	<li>portability</li>
	<li>openess of specifications</li>
	<li>authentication options</li>
	<li>performance</li>
	<li>ease of use</li>
</ul>
While it is not so obvious which method to prefer in general - most methods have their merits for a limited 
number of tasks - it is quite obvious which methods to avoid: those which are not well specified, where
specifications are locked in with a particular vendor, and those which are not portable across platforms.
</p>
<p>
An example for a project suffering from a major delay and unneccessary costs by not heeding these principles
is the Australian GEHR: despite warnings and protests from experienced developers the GEHR group attempted
to use the proprietary single platform (Microsoft) COM system to implement inter process communication and
of course failed in that attempt as predicted. However, the project did not learn from previous mistakes 
and engaged in a new project using ActiveX - yet another entirely proprietary single platform (Microsoft) 
protocol. 
</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that such projects a re taxpayer funded, one has to ask why such needlessly 
shortsighted lock-in into proprietary technology with unpredicatble future could be allowed in the 
budgeting process. Development of such ActiveX components is yet another lost investment. With little
consideration towards choice of tools and methods long term reusable benefits could have been 
achieved with little to no extra effort.

<h4>Examples for RPC / distributed objects:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><b>XML-RPC:</b><br> a very lightweight protocol (in terms of implmentation effort). Fully portable,
	                    open and well defined specifications, increasingly popular. Uses HTTP
						as sole carrier protocol, and can use the very basic authentication functionality
						of HTTP as well, but requires extra implementation effort for this.<br>
						Secure connections can be achieved transparently via SSL, which requires
						extra implementation effort too. Performance is not good due to HTTP and XML
						overhead. Persistent connections can decrease connection overhead, but require
						extra implementation effort.<br>
						It's main benefit is in it's simplicity: free XML-RPC libraries are abundant for
						most programming languages</li> <br>
	<li><b>SOAP:</b><br>SOAP can be seen as an extension of XML-RPC. Messages are XML encoded
						as well, but the carrier protocol is not specified to HTTP any more. As XML-RPC,
						SOAP itself does not provide authentication and transport layer security
						functionality. Microsoft is commonly blamed for having destroyed the future
						of SOAP by manipulating the specifications in a way that they will break the
						universality and allow vendor lock in.</li> <br>
						
	<li><b>CORBA</b><br>
						</li><br>
