<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<P>The benefits of computerized health records are indisputable, and
further benefits are expected from the implementation of computerized
decision support. However, current systems are only implementing a
small fraction of the potential benefits. The government has been
called upon to finance development of software projects aiming at
improving health outcome and saving costs to the health system.</P>
<P>However, there are no guidelines as to which projects to support,
under what conditions. So far, ?? Australian taxpayers dollars have
been spent on ?? projects, arguably without any major tangible
outcome. While each project in itself may have its merits, the lack
of interoperability and reusability reduced the long term benefits
of such software close to zero. Since virtually all projects
purchased or commissioned software without getting access to its
source code, that software cannot even serve for learning purposes
for our upcoming generations of health informaticians. We may conclude 
that most of the project money spent so far on software has been wasted.</P>
<P>Current common practice is to put a software project to tender,
and have a small set of end user specifications implemented by a
vendor. Typically, implementation details are not specified and
source code remains property of the vendor. Even in the few cases 
where the public ownership of the source code
was specified in the contract, the tender missed to specify that availability
of source code needs to extend to 3rd party libraries and all non-replaceable 
software tools. (The software must be extensible and maintainable without
any requirements for proprietary 3rd party libraries or tools).
</p>
<p>
In the worst case,
monopolies are fostered by the choice of vendors which misuse such
publicly funded projects in order to lock customer into their
proprietary solutions, effectively not only depriving customers of a
choice but also choking the competition which might have been able to
offer better alternatives in the future. 'Once a customer is &quot;locked
into&quot; proprietary software, its makers can demand premium
prices, safe in the knowledge that the client would find it even more
expensive to change' [<a href="references.html#[1]">1</a>,2]</P>
<p>It is also essential to involve clinicians throughout all phases of planning and
decision making regarding health related software:<br>
"Health care IT is led almost exclusively 
by commercial vendors and health care corporate management information services (MIS) 
departments. There is a poverty of clinician leadership.<br>
Even medical informaticists, clinicians ideally qualified to provide such leadership, 
often find themselves poorly accepted in vendor and MIS shops. This may be due to 
territorial issues, cultural differences, and methodological differences. 
One such methodological difference is <b><i>the clinician's favoring of a participatory 
approach to application development</i></b>, which represents a significant departure from 
traditional information system design.This may make those in industry or MIS uncomfortable." 
[25,26]</p>
<P>In order to maximize benefits from publicly funded software, a
minimum policy should be implemented. This document is aiming at
providing a rationale for such a policy.</P>
