<h3>Portable Cryptographic Toolkits</h3>
Security in general and especially cryptography are domains where open
source software excells; for a number of reasons comercial software is always lagging
behind and can never offer the same level of trust. Trust is derived from knowledge; 
hence, where the source code cannot be inspected, trust cannot arise. The danger of Trojan
code cannot be overestimated: even in the most serious companies a single 
disgruntled employee can wreak havoc by embedding arbitrary code in any closed source 
software with very low likelihood of detection before harm is done.
<p>
Standard compliance is most important: even if just a single user is concerned, he needs the 
confidence that he still will be able to decrypt the file he encrypted today in
20 years time. Relying on proprietary binary-only non-standard compliant tools invariably
means that the user will not be able to decrypt his files any more after any considerable
length of time: proprietary hard- and software platforms do not usually prevail for decades.
If two users want to communicate in private, it would be most impractical to rely on
proprietary tools: the assumption that any communication partner will always have access
to the same proprietary tool is more often than not wrong.
</p>
<p>Whenever security is involved, portability is crucial. After all, the weakest link
in the chain is usually the end user. If the end user is presented a consistent 
interface to cryptography in all applications across all platforms, confusion and frustration 
are less likely to happen. As a consequence, one can expect increased compliance with security 
policies.
