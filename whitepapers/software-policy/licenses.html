<H2>The choice of license</H2>

<H3>Why it matters:</H3>
	The license will
	ultimately determine who will benefit from a software product. When a
	project is put to tender spending public money, a license should be
	chosen that will maximise the taxpayers benefit.
	
<H3>What different licensing schemes are available?	</h3>
<ol>
	<LI><b>'closed source' licensing scheme:</b> The contractor preserves all rights on the software and
	sells licenses to the end user. The end user has no rights nor
	possibility to modify the software. There are three possible
	alternatives, each with an optional escrow clause:
	
	<OL>
		<LI> <b>purchase scheme:</b> the user pays once for unlimited rights of use as
		outlined in the software purchase contract.
		The user has no rights of redistribution nor modification
		<LI><b>subscription scheme:</b> the user has
		rights of use for a determined period of time, after which the he
		has to renew the license or cease usage
		<LI><b>closed source public domain release:</b> the user has unlimited 
		rights of use and redistribution, but no facilities for modifying, porting,
		or improving the software.
	</OL>
	<br>
	<li><b>source escrow:</b> the vendor deposits
	the source code and developer documentation with a trusted third
	party. The licensing agreement determines when and under which 
	conditions this source code is to be released. Otherwise, this
	license works as the closed source licensing schemes
	</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>open source licensing:</b>
	the contractor has to surrender intellectual property, but may
	retain copyright. There is a large number of possible schemes.
	Examples for often used or discussed schemes are:
	<ol>
		<LI><b>BSD style license:</b>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, 
		with or without modification, are permitted provided that a number of conditions are met,
		often including an advertising clause
		</li>
		<LI><b>GPL style license:</b> the copyright
		remains with the original owner, but the user is granted all rights
		to modify and redistribute the software under the proviso that
		derived/redistributed products and/or products using this software
		in any other direct way are licensed under the same
		licensing scheme.</li>
		<LI><b>LGPL style license:</b> basically the
		same as GPL, but this license is not 'contagious': it requires same
		licensing (LGPL) only for derivatives or direct redistributions.</P>
		<LI><b>'shared source':</b> some or all of the source code is released
		in a discriminative way, but the vendor prohibits any
		modifications or redistribution.</P>
	</ol>
</ol>
<h3>Advantages of closed source licenses:</h3>
for the customer, there are none at all, since any perceived
advantage is also available for open source licenses as well. 
An exception would be a slightly lower initial purchasing cost if
the vendor intends to resell the software to multiple other customers.
However, this usually marginal cost reduction is almost always offset
by the lost investment factor, since such software cannot be reused or 
extended. Hence, all advantages of closed source software are unilaterally 
with the vendor. Thus, it is not in the taxpayers
interest to invest in closed source software.
<h3>Disadvantages of closed source software licenses:</h3>
Closed source software is typically limited to only one
platform or a small number of platforms. The end user is deprived of
choice regarding hardware and operating system. Problems arise with
virtually any hard-and/or software upgrade where the user is at the
mercy of the vendor who may or may not provide a suitable upgrade.
There is ample evidence of the disastrous consequences of closed
source software licensing for large scale governmental projects
[1...]

<P>Further problems arise when it comes to
system integration. Typically, closed source software lacks well
defined APIs or RPC interfaces that would facilitate integration.
Should the need for integration arise, there is no option for the
licensee to implement the necessary changes. Even where such API
or RPC interface exists, the fact that it cannot be modified pre-programs
artefactual obsolescence which cannot be in the interest of the user
</P>
<P>Closed source software also stifles
and distorts competition, since competitors will suffer from the same
restrictions as the licensee, and thus will be unable to provide a
customer with a better / distinctive service for that particular
product.
</P>
<p>While Microsoft's proposal of "shared code" will allow limited
peer review of security sensitive code and, under certain circumstances, also
allow implementation of interfaces, it is generally regarded as a mere
publicity stunt without any real benefit to the customer [7]</p>

<h3>Advantages of open source licenses</h3>
At first glance all advantages appear to be with the customer, who can 
<ul>
<li>inspect the code for errors and specification compliance</li>
<li>reuse or extend the code for related projects</li>
<li>contract a different vendor/developer for further development
or ongoing maintenance when need arises</li>
<li>scrutinize the code for security loopholes</li>
<li>port the code to different platforms</li>
</ul>
However, there are also numerous benefits to vendors:
<ul>
<li>they too can benefit from an existing pool of open sourced modules</li>
<li>they can prove compliance with specifications and security demands</li>
<li>small business will have equal opportunities for tasks adequate to the 
business size: not all vendors see competition as negative</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages of open source licenses</h3>
The main disadvantage is for the vendor, since he cannot exert vendor lock-in
manoeuvres with open source software. Open source licensing effectively
breaks monopolies. However, for the customer this is always an advantage.
<p>People unfamiliar with IT security might perceive open code as an invitation
for hackers; those without in depth security knowledge often assume that
obscurity can provide security. This assumption has been proven wrong repeatedly.
It is now commonly accepted in professional circles that peer review is a
requirement for security. It is no coincidence that closed source companies
like Microsoft have a disastrous security track record.</p>
<p>Purchasing the full so called intellectual property in the form of source code
might incur extra costs. These extra costs need to be weighed against the expected benefits.
As a rule of thumb one might expect that minor projects require that little funding that
the extra costs are too small to matter, and large projects would cost too much anyway
to allow a lost investment in the form of closed source software, so that again the extra 
costs (if any) for the disclosure of the source code would be worthwhile in the long term</p>
<h3>Recommendation regarding choice of software licensing scheme:</h3>
The recommendation to be made is clear:
<i>closed source licensing schemes are to be avoided</i>. They are generally
unacceptable in security sensitive applications since they do not allow peer
review. Closed source software is more often than not a lost investment, since
it can rarely be reused or extended nor adapted when interoperability requires it.
Even if purchasing the source code and related rights might cost more initially, 
this one off cost is likely to be more than balanced by the long term benefits.
