<h2>The 6 steps towards a good software tender</h2>
<hr>
In order to achieve the goals of interoperability, reusability, and standard compliance 
the contract needs to be drafted accordingly. Of course, all common contract issues such as 
goal specifications, budget,default handling etc. need to be considered. This is usually no problem,
since anybody used to drafting contracts will know how to do this.<br>
However, in the case of publicly funded software, there are a few extra requirements that are essential
as well: no contract should be put to tender which doesn't specify in detail <i>all</i> of the following
issues:
<ol>
	<li><b>Which license for the end product?</b><br>
	The license will ultimately determine the long term value of any software
	</li>
	<li><b>What platform shall be supported?</b><br>
	It is unwise to restrict the choice of platform artificially without good reason.
	</li>
	<li><b>What programming languages and software tools can be used?</b><br>
	The choice of development tools has a major impact on interoperability and reusability 
	</li>
	<li><b>What API and/or RPC interface is to be used?</b><br>
	Standardised APIs and RPC interfaces will increase interoperability
	and reusability dramatically.
	</li>
	<li><b>Which existing components are to be reused or extended?</b><br>
	Reuse of existing components fosters standards and saves money
	</li>
	<li><b>What standards are to be used?</b><br>
	The choice of standard is essential for interoperability
	</li>
</ol>
The rest of this document intends to clarify these six core issues. It will be highlighted why these
issues are important, and advice will be given regarding relevant software contract specifications.
