<h2>Conclusions</h2>
In order to maximize the benefit obtained for taxpayers money, any software contract should
clarify the following on top of the usual project specifications:
<ol>
	<li><b>choice of license:</b> preferably GPL</li>
	<li><b>choice of architecture:</b> modular portable design</li>
	<li><b>choice of platform:</b> preferably portable, no unnecessary platform restrictions</li>
	<li><b>choice of language:</b> preferably a high level, open standard language 
	(Examples: Python, Eiffel, C++, (Java), PHP) whenever hardware and performance allow it</li>
	<li><b>choice of tools:</b> preferably no need for proprietary tools 
	(use of proprietary tools for convenience is allowable as long as these tools are not indispensible
	for building, maintaining or extending this software )</li>
	<li><b>choice of interface:</b> well formulated API, and preferably standard cross platform interfaces
	and protocols like XML-RPC, SOAP or CORBA</li>
	<li><b>choice of standards:</b> whenever any aspect of the software can be implemented through 
	or make use of an approved standard, this standard has to be used</li>
	<li><b>choice of 3rd party software / toolkits:</b> Existing software modules that comply with all 
	of the above should be reused, extended or modified in preference to re-developing. Software products
	not compliant with the stated specifications should no be used at all.</li>
</ol>
