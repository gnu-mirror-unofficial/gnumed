<H2>Features desirable for all software projects</H2>
<hr>
	<h3>Interoperability:</h3>
	in health informatics, there will
	rarely be a case where a specific piece of software will be useful
	in isolation. In virtually all cases, maximum benefit can be
	achieved by integrating software modules into a larger architecture. <br>
	To that purpose, software needs to be designed modular with well
	defined interfaces. It is desirable to achieve interoperability across
	different platforms; for that purpose, only open standards for 
	inter-component communication should be used
	<h3>Reusability:</h3>
	In order to maximise reusability, the source code 
	has to be open and portable. This will not only allow other developers to 
	benefit from an already existing code base and thus decrease costs of 
	future projects, but it will also allow students to learn from an existing
	code base. It will facilitate an evolutionary development process which is
	likely to lead to better code quality and interoperability as well. Having to 
	"reinvent the wheel" repeatedly is counter productive. Open and portable code
	will prevent both vendor lock-in as well as vendor driven premature obsolescence.
	<h3>Standard compliance:</h3>
	Whenever useable standards exist, no attempt should be made at using or even developing 
	a proprietary 
	solution instead. Should existing standards not cover the needs completely, it is
	preferable to extend existing standards or, even better, to influence the
	standard body to adopt proposed extensions into a new revision of that standard.
