<p>
SQL is standard nowadays as a query language for database servers. Not diffferent in GNUMed.
While most users will rely on the graphical user interface when they want to interact with the
database backend, there will always be circumstances requiring more sophisticated access
methods as for example for an epidemiological drill down.
</p>
<p>
For this purpose, GNUMed provides an interactive SQL window within the GUI client. It saves the
user the hassle of having to recur to the command line.

Future enhancements will include a graphical query builder similar to the ones known from pgAccess or MS Access
