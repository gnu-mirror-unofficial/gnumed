>&#13;	    From a medico-legal point of view it is important to track who
	    changed what data when. GnuMed uses database level facilities
	    to achieve that goal. Advantages are that SQL query parsing is
	    left to the database engine, that the backend provides uniform
	    auditing across any variety of client, and that data is moved
	    locally which provides for reasonable speeds. Drawbacks are
	    that audit trail data cannot be transferred remotely right away
	    particularly conveniently and that this scheme is not foolproof
	    against manipulation.

></H2
><P
>		Currently SELECTs are not logged. While some legislation may
		require this it does not make sense technically, will slow down
		the database considerably and is better left to middleware
		or frontend. The main argument against SELECT logging at the
		database level is that the intended purpose of it would be to
		enable later investigation of unauthorized disclosure. However,
		a logged SELECT in no way proves any disclosure to any specific
		target. A missing SELECT does not contribute any useful evidence
		against disclosure either. Unauthorized disclosure is largely
		a social-control/policy issue. There's no such thing as
		"unauthorized access". If access occurred it was authorized
		(barring any software bugs). Such security breaches must be
		prevented by other means.

>5.6.4. How to add an audit trail to a table</A
></H2
><P
>		Any table that is supposed to be audited must inherit
		from the audit marker table "audit_mark". In order for
		auditing to actually work a corresponding audit trail
		table must be created. Audit trail tables customarily
		start with the prefix "log_" and must inherit from
		the audit trail root table "audit_trail". Those
		parameters are, of course, configurable. The audit
		trail tables need not contain all the columns in the
		audited table but they may not contain any additional
		columns except for those inherited from the audit trail
		root table.
	    	</P
><P
>		During bootstrapping all marked tables that have a
		corresponding audit trail table are prepared for
		auditing. The necessary functions and triggers are
		automatically generated and inserted into the database.
		If you know of a dependable way of generating audit
		trail tables from audited tables please contact the
		author. Until then, audit trail tables must be pre-
		defined just as the original tables but without any
		constraints except for "not null" where appropriate.
		There are some examples in server/sql/gmclinical.sql.

>		Over time the audit trail tables may grow quite large.
		They may be dumped and cleaned out regularly. The
		dump file should be notarized digitally and backed up.
		Preferably an unsigned online copy of the audit trail
		tables should be moved to another server. It is useful
		to have the complete revision history online for
		reference but this is not speed-critical.
